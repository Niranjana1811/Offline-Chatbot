### Project Description 
This offline chatbot, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enables interactive communication without internet access. It processes user inputs locally through predefined rules and keyword matching, providing prompt responses while ensuring privacy and efficient client-side operation.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist) 
Talking to a bot that never takes a coffee break or needs internet — so you can chat anytime, anywhere, even in airplane mode!
### The Solution (that nobody asked for) 
We’re solving it by creating a lightweight chatbot that runs entirely offline in the user’s browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It processes user input locally through predefined rules and keyword matching, so no internet connection is needed for instant responses anytime, anywhere.
## Technical Details 
### Technologies/Components Used 
For Software: - [HTML, CSS, JavaScript] - [None(vanilla JavaScript)] - [None] - [V S Code] 

### Implementation 
For Software: The chatbot is implemented as a web-based application using HTML for the interface, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. User inputs are captured via input fields, and JavaScript processes these inputs by matching keywords or patterns against predefined responses stored within the code. The chatbot dynamically updates the conversation display without refreshing the page, enabling real-time interaction entirely on the client side without any server or internet dependency.
# Installation 
[npm install -g live-server] 
# Run 
[Right-click on your index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".] 
### Project Documentation 
For Software: This project is a simple chatbot built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that works completely offline. It runs in a web browser and responds to user inputs based on predefined rules and keywords. No internet connection or external libraries are needed, making it easy to use anywhere. The chatbot provides basic conversational interaction and can be run by simply opening the HTML file in any modern browser.

The chatbot takes user input from a text box, then uses JavaScript to check for specific keywords or phrases. Based on these matches, it selects and displays predefined responses—all running locally in the browser without needing internet access.
